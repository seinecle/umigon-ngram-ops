### What?
Functions to create ngrams __and then to clean them__. Explanation:

- âœ… it is easy to create unigrams, bi-grams, tri-grams and 4-grams in a text. An example of a 4-gram is ```United States of America``` (4 terms long)
- ðŸ”´ howevever, such a function will also list the following 3-grams: ```United States of``` and also ```States of America```, which are clearly irrelevant
- âœ… for this reason, this repo includes a function called ```NGramDuplicatesCleaner``` which removes these quasi-duplicates.
- âž• optionally, the cleaner can take a set of stopwords as a parameter to its constructor, which will help achieve better results.

### How to use it?

#### To detect n-grams:
```java
List<String> input = new ArrayList();
input.add("This is my first sentence");
input.add("This is my second sentence");
NGramFinder ngramFinder = new NGramFinder(input);
Map<String, Integer> ngrams = ngramFinder.run(4, false);
```

- The result is a map where they key is the n-gram, and the value is the count of this n-gram.
- The parameter ```4``` means that the nGram detector will identify 2, 3 and 4 grams.
- The parameter ```false``` means that _for a given input String_, an ngram will be counted just once (even if it appears several times within this piece of text). In practice, this means all the keys will have a value of 1 in the Map returned by the function.

#### To clean n-grams (see above)
```java
NGramDuplicatesCleaner cleaner = new NGramDuplicatesCleaner();
Map<String, Integer> cleanedNGrams = cleaner.removeDuplicates(ngrams, 4,true);
```
- The result is a map where they keys are the cleaned n-grams, and the values are the counts for cleaned n-grams.
- The parameter ```4``` means that the nGram cleaner will work on 2, 3 and 4 grams.
- The parameter ```true``` means that ngrams appearing just once will be removed.

#### New: n-gram detection with data structures
The new class `NGramDetectionBisForTextFragment` is part of the wider umigon family project, which introduces data structures to handle text ops with rigor. In particular, the data structures allow for the preservation of the indices of text fragments even with the detection of n-grams and the removal of (some, not all) punctuation signs.
